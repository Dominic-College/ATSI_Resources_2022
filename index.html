					<p class="paragraph-main" style="max-width:65%;">For thousands of years Aboriginal Tasmanians have walked this land, on their own country as custodians to their earth mother. Their unbroken relationship with the land, waters and sea was and remains to be at the Centre of their lives. These lands, now called Dominic College, were the lands of the muwinina people, who belonged to one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world. We acknowledge and remember the muwinina people who are now lost to us. We acknowledge all Aboriginal Tasmanians, today’s pakana people, those of the past, the present and the future, and, with gratitude and respect, we recognise their continued relationship, custodianship and their bond with Country throughout the ages.</p>

					<p>The Uluru Statement from the Heart is an invitation to the Australian people from First Nations Australians.

					<h1 class="heading">AIATSIS Map of Indigenous Australia</h1>
					<p>The AIATSIS map serves as a visual reminder of the richness and diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australia. It was created in 1996 as part of the Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia project and attempts to show language, social or nation groups based on published sources available up to 1994.</p>
					<p>The map shows only the general locations of larger groups of people which may include smaller groups. There are also variations in the way that some language or group names are spelt.</p>
